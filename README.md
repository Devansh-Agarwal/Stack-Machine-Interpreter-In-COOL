# Stack-Machine-Interpreter-In-COOL
This is a simple stack machine interpreter implemented in COOL. 
I implemented this as an assignment to get familiar with the COOL Language. The details of what this interpreter 
can do is given in the file ProblemStatementStackMachineInterpreter.pdf.
The cool atoi library is used in this code.
To run use command:
$ coolc StackMachineInterpreter.cl
$ spim  StackMachineInterpreter.s
